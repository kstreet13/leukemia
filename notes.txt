Recommendation from Shahab
Leukemia microenvironment, Wnt signalling
T/B cell leukemia = decent prognosis unless relapse (10-20%)
(T-ALL, B-ALL)
Survival is better in children
Wnt signaling is up in cancer (beta catenin is central to it)
TBL1 is downstream, aim to disrupt link with drug
Relapse patients have higher TBL1
Drug is in phase 1 clinical trials
Big question: how does drug really work? How do we achieve apoptosis? What genes are affected?
Future: would like to use scRNAseq for (2nd) mouse model
Reviewers wanted a bioinformatician
Can we integrate ChIP-Seq and RNA-Sequencing?
# YMK1-3 = T-ALL
# YMK4-6 = B-ALL
# first sample = untreated
# second and third = treated, different timepoints
# all cells are leukemia cells, won't find different types, just different subpopulations
# subpopulation dynamics
Want: DE by treatment
Samantha will send list of marker genes, make violin plots
